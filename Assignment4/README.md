# Assignment 4

First kindly following the following GitHub link to understand the python implementation of the paper:  "A New Image Contrast Enhancement Algorithm Using Exposure Fusion Framework"

https://github.com/AndyHuang1995/Image-Contrast-Enhancement

1. Implement in python of the  following Matlab implemented  concepts  <br>(https://github.com/b1sakher/Contrast-enhancement-in-digital-images) <br> and link of details are available at  <br>https://www.slideshare.net/SakherBELOUADAH/contrast-enhancement-in-digital-images

        i-Local color correction 

        ii-Simplest color balance

        iii-Screened Poisson Equation for Image Contrast Enhancement

2. Implement  in python of research [paper 1](Paper1_AMF_paper.pdf) which is attached 

3. Implement  in python of research paper [2](Paper%202_Fast_AHE_04129083.pdf) or  [3](Paper3_CLAHE_method.pdf) which are attached
