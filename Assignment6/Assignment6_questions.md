# Assignment 6

1. Write python code from scratch for JPEG compression for image ([lena.jpg](lena.jpg)) and demonstrate results of each step and also compare final result with OpenCV functions in terms of in terms of RMSE and PSNR (dB).

2. Write python code from scratch for Adaptive Huffman coding explained by author in research [paper 1](Paper_1_Adaptive%20Huffman%20coding.pdf) and demonstrate results of each step.

3. Write python code from scratch for Modified BTC for natural image compression   explained by author in research [paper 2](Paper2_Modified%20BTC_1979.pdf) ([barba.png](barba.png)) and demonstrate results of each step. Also compare the results with original BTC algorithm in terms of RMSE and PSNR (dB).
